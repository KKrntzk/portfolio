    >I invite you to interact with these projects to see my approach to the modern web—where I
    prioritize writing efficient, lean code to build interfaces that are as responsive as they are
    intuitive. For me, a great project isn't just about how it looks, but how effortlessly it moves
    and responds to the user. I'm always learning and refining my process, so I’d love for you to
    explore the builds and see how I bridge the gap between complex code and a seamless user
    journey.</span
