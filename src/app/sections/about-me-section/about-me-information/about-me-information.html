    >I’m a Frontend Developer who views code as a form of modern-day sorcery. I love the challenge
    of transforming a blank page into an immersive, interactive experience—blending clean logic with
    creative design. I draw my drive from the complex magic systems in the fantasy novels I read.
    Just like a great story, a great interface needs internal consistency and a touch of wonder. I’m
    constantly learning new "spells" in my tech stack to ensure every user journey feels effortless
    and enchanting. When the screen goes dark, you’ll find me with a cup of tea and a fantasy epic
    in hand—always curious, always dreaming up the next build. </span
